"""Mutation check for the sensor joins: every mutant must turn the tests red.

Each mutant replaces one exact piece of source in the launcher's join, origin
or coverage logic, runs the launcher's unit tests, and restores the file. A
mutant the tests do not kill means a guarantee no test holds. Run from the
repository root:
