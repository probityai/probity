# Agent Evidence Observer (prototype)

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/agent-evidence-observer.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/agent-evidence-observer/)
[![Downloads (PePy)](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/agent-evidence-observer)](https://pepy.tech/projects/agent-evidence-observer)

Record brokered agent writes and check selected native framework reports offline.

Use it in agent harnesses and evaluation pipelines that need replayable action records or a consumer gate for retained reports.

Install the root package: `pip install agent-evidence-observer==0.1.0`.

## Quick start

Run the demo from the released package. You need Python 3.12 or later and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/); there is nothing to clone.

```sh
uvx agent-evidence-observer==0.1.0 demo ./sample-run
uvx agent-evidence-observer==0.1.0 verify ./sample-run
```

The two commands print:

```text
{"noDetectedGap": "true", "retryReplayed": "true", "status": "verified", "witnessScope": "PEER"}
{"noDetectedGap": "true", "status": "verified", "witnessScope": "PEER"}
```

`sample-run/` now holds the signed packet, the history, the public keys and the file tree. The demo
writes a file, retries it, and the retry returns the first effect. `noDetectedGap` means the broker's
file-tree snapshots found no change it did not make. It does not mean every agent effect was seen.
To run from a pinned source checkout instead, see [Run the source quick start](https://github.com/probityai/probity/blob/main/packages/observer/docs/INSTALLATION.md#run-the-source-quick-start).

## Status

The root distribution is version 0.1.0. Every record says `witnessScope: PEER`: the witness key runs on the same
host under the same operator, so the records show what this broker saw, not what an independent
observer saw. Linux runs can launch a fixed probe, or a Python script given to `run-workload`, under
bubblewrap with only the broker's socket exposed. `launch-agent` runs an unmodified agent in docker or
apptainer and records, from outside it, every program it ran and every file it changed. It does not use
bubblewrap, which cannot start on hosts with `apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=1` such as Ubuntu 24.04.
`agent-evidence-witness` runs a separately operated witness: a record it co-signs verifies as `EXTERNAL`
when the reader pins a different operator for the witness key. It needs the `witness` extra, which is not yet
in a released wheel.
