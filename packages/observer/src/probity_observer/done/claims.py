"""Parse what an agent says it ran into a ``probity-tool-claims/v1`` record.

Claims are the agent's statements, so they come from its own output and carry no vantage.
Two transcript shapes are read:

- **plain text** (any agent run by the launcher): a line ``$ <command>`` is a claimed run of
  that command; a later test summary (``N passed``, ``All tests passed``, ``OK``) with no
  failure claims that run's exit was 0. A summary with no claimed command before it is a claim
  that the contract's first visible acceptance command ran and passed, which is how a
  fabricated ``12 passed`` becomes a checkable claim;
- **Claude Code ``stream-json``** (:func:`from_claude_stream`): each ``Bash`` tool call is a
  claimed run of its command, and its tool result's error flag gives the claimed exit.

A shell command line is split with :mod:`shlex`; a line that does not split, or that uses
shell syntax beyond one simple command, is claimed as ``["sh", "-c", <line>]``.

When the contract seals ``cwd`` and ``exe`` for the acceptance commands the agent runs
itself, only claims of those commands are kept, under their sealed argv: a command line with
the sealed arguments whose program is the sealed ``argv[0]``, a sealed ``exe`` path or its name
(a contract may seal every path of one interpreter file, ``python`` and ``python3``), also inside a
one-command ``sh -c`` or ``bash -lc``. Other commands the agent ran (``ls -R``, an editor call)
say nothing about done and are left out, with their output. A test summary counts only in a kept
command's output or in the agent's own text, never under a ``# <tool>`` line, where the agent displays a file or a tool
result (a viewed ``test.py`` that prints "All tests passed!" is not a test run). A line
``[exit N]`` in a kept command's output states that run's exit. Only the agent's last claim of
each sealed command is kept, because the verifier settles a claim on that command's last run,
and only when it does not state a failure, because a run the agent says failed is no claim of
done.
