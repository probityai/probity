"""Join the three sensors into the done-receipt records the verifier reads.

S2 (the in-container trace) is the event source: it alone sees processes,
argv, exit statuses and which command caused an effect. S1 (host inotify) is
the cross-check: every change S1 saw inside the workspace must match an S2
event on the same path. A change S2 did not record means the trace missed an
effect, so it is added to the record without an ``origin``, conservatively
counting as an edit, and the observation names a coverage gap around it. S3
(the final tree) becomes the tree record.

The output formats are the ones ``probity-verify`` defines in
``docs/done-receipt.md``, in the versions this module adds to:
``probity-observation/v3`` (an exec event carries the executed path ``exe``,
its working directory ``cwd`` and the loader environment ``env``, all as
container paths under the declared ``workspace_root``; a ``connect`` carries
its ``address``; and ``external_mutations`` lists every mutation outside the
workspace, numbered in the same step sequence as ``events``, with its
absolute ``paths``, its ``origin`` and its ``location``, ``grader_path`` or
``outside_workspace``, see :func:`location`),
``probity-capabilities/v1`` and ``probity-tree/v2`` (every non-directory
entry, symbolic links and special files included; see
:mod:`.sensors.treedigest`). Those records are strict
and carry no launch detail, so the launch digest, the exact trace expression,
the inotify watch list and the join's findings
go into the receipt beside them (``probity-launch-receipt/v1``). The receipt's
``witnessScope`` is the observer's own field; the verify records carry the same
value as ``witness_scope``.
